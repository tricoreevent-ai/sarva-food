## Runtime Budgets

| Surface | Budget | Current control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POS category switch | <50ms | Debounced search, precomputed product arrays, memoized product cards. |
| Kitchen realtime update | <100ms | Snapshot reconciliation, memoized cards, desktop queue windowing. |
| Memory stability | 30 minutes stable | No new unbounded listeners/timers; manual Chrome heap profiling required. |
| CPU usage | Minimized | Expensive filter/sort paths are memoized or debounced where touched. |
