# Performance Phase 3 Report

Date: 2026-07-29T11:52:32.690Z

## Scope

Final runtime smoothness pass for Customer, Owner, Kitchen, and POS without changing business workflows, APIs, Firestore schema, auth, payment, or repository contracts.

## Implementation Summary

| Phase | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Owner Orders | Search filtering is debounced; hidden partner integration UI is dynamically loaded; active row component is memo-ready. |
| Owner Settings | Heavy tab-only dependencies are dynamically loaded: Mapbox, Cloudinary upload, push settings, fullscreen, loyalty rules. |
| Kitchen | Stream deltas reconcile changed tickets; cards are memoized by ticket reference/minute bucket; desktop columns use lightweight windowing for long queues. |
| POS | Product search is debounced; menu/custom product arrays are precomputed; product grid/cards are memoized; cart item actions use stable refs. |
| Profile | App preferences and react-hot-toast runtime are no longer static profile startup imports. |

## Remaining Manual Gates

Production Chrome Performance/Coverage/Memory, authenticated owner/POS/Kitchen smoke, 30-minute heap stability, hosted Lighthouse/Core Web Vitals, and real provider/hardware validation remain manual gates.
