## Measurement Inputs

| Source | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Build route manifests | Read from `.next/server/app/**/page_client-reference-manifest.js`. |
| Browser profiler | No local Chrome/Lighthouse executable is assumed by this script; production Chrome Performance remains manual. |
| Synthetic load | 100 kitchen orders and 1000 POS products measured with Node performance timers. |

## Notes

Hydration time, FPS, long tasks, Chrome memory, and real network waterfalls still require hosted production Chrome profiling because this workspace script cannot observe browser main-thread scheduling.

RC5 waiter workflow adds no new realtime listener or heavyweight dependency; the stage board reuses memoized Active Order cards and derives Kitchen/payment/progress labels from existing order data.
